inanimate objects, walls, pedestrians, etc.). Autonomous cars may have a
number of other modern features that affect car safety (changes to the car's 
interface, display, etc.). These are not accounted for in the existing statement.

financial effects which may be ""devastating"" to an individual or family. Because 
gambling has been proven to be addictive and affect finances of an individual or
