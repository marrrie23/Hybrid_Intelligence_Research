# Hybrid Intelligence in Fallacy Identification 
This repository contains data and analysis scripts for two studies conducted using Qualtrics and a chatbot interface.

## Files

- `Combined_Study1_answers.csv`: Contains answers collected from the Qualtrics survey for Study 1.
- `Combined_Study2_answers.csv`: Contains answers collected from the chatbot interactions for Study 2.
- `qualtrics_sets.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the dataset used in both studies.
- `study_1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with results and analysis of Study 1, which focused on human-only interactions.
- `study_2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with results and analysis of Study 2, which involved hybrid intelligence combining human and chatbot interactions.

## Description

- **Study 1**: This study primarily utilized Qualtrics for data collection and analysis. The results are presented in `study_1.ipynb`.
  
- **Study 2**: This study involved interactions with a chatbot alongside human participants. The combined data from the chatbot interactions are stored in `Combined_Study2_answers.csv`. The findings and insights from Study 2 can be found in `study_2.ipynb`.

## Usage

You can explore the datasets and the analysis of both studies using the provided Jupyter Notebooks (`study_1.ipynb` and `study_2.ipynb`). The datasets used in both studies are available in `qualtrics_sets.ipynb`.

Feel free to use the code and datasets for further research or analysis, keeping in mind the respective licenses and ethical considerations for using survey and interaction data.
